What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Thoughts:
	 When we initiliaze a repository, a .git files appear in the directory and now we can use git commands to make changes in the files present in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Thoughts:
	 A good way to commit the changes is one logical change per commit so if there are two files, we want to add in single commit then we have to add it first to staging area one by one and then we can commit them in bundle.
