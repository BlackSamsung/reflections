What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Thoughts:
	 When we initiliaze a repository, a .git files appear in the directory and now
	 we can use git commands to make changes in the files present in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
Thoughts:
	 A good way to commit the changes is one logical change per commit so if there
	  are two files, we want to add in single commit then we have to add it first
		to staging area one by one and then we can commit them in bundle.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
 change?
 Thoughts:
 					suppose we have make changes in two files and that will count as one
					logical change then we can transfer those files into staging area and
					after passing these files into staging area we can commit them into
					single change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Thoughts:
					Branches are really helpful when you want to test new features but you
					don't want to introduced in your master branch.
					Suppose you want to make different language version of your app then
					you can use the branch feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Thoughts:
				Diagrams helps you to visualize the branch structure, each commit is
				related to their parent commit and if there is any commit which is not
				related to any branch we can easily find out by diagrams.
