How did viewing a diff between two versions of file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Thoughts:
          Well diff function is really useful in order to see the difference
          between two versions of files. It helped me to find out my typos and
          other silly mistakes.
          diff organise the differences and highlighted them for us to see.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Thoughts:
         Here comes the reflections into the game, because you can see entire
         history of your work and you can easily find the mistakes that you were
         doing and that really helps you learn.
