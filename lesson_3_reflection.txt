When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Thoughts:
  Remote repository is helpful if you want to push your local repository to
  Github account and make it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thoughts:
  Having manually pull changes gives you authority that you want to take that
  change or not in your project.
  If git automatically stays up-to-date with the remote repository then the
  change will automatically be pulled in your local machine whether you want to
  take it or not and you would not like it to be happened.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It helps when you are working offline and you want to merge those changes into
your own branches and for that you need to know what the remote version is at
some point.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
If I'm not using Git or Github while collaborating on a project, I might use
other options like shared folder, dropbox or google docs but these all can't
replace Git version control. Because it gives you the flexibility to make
changes fearlessly and try out new things on your code and you can find out the
bugs very easily.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Master branch is the official version of your project and you want it to run at
any time so if you are modifying your code or want to add new feature you should
make a new branch and do the changes. By this way you will not affect the master
branch and if everything is fine, you can merge master branch into your branch
later.
