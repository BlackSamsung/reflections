When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Thoughts:
  Remote repository is helpful if you want to push your local repository to
  Github account and make it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thoughts:
  Having manually pull changes gives you authority that you want to take that
  change or not in your project.
  If git automatically stays up-to-date with the remote repository then the
  change will automatically be pulled in your local machine whether you want to
  take it or not and you would not like it to be happened.
